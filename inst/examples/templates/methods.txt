In 2014 and 2015, we quantified decomposition of plant litter material collected from each plot.  In late May, we collected vascular plant litter from the surface of each plot, along with Sphagnum peat (S. fuscum-derived), from roughly 5-15 cm below the capitula.  We placed nylon mesh litter bags with mixed vascular plant litter (approx. 1.7 g dry mass; roughly equal masses of Rhododendron groenlandicum, Andromeda polifolia, Chamaedaphne calyculata, Smilacina trifolia, and Rubus chamaemorus) or peat approximately 10 cm below the peat surface in early June (in 2014, 3 bags per plot of vascular litter and 3 bags of Sphagnum peat; in 2015, 4 bags of each material).  Upon retrieval in October of each year, we manually removed debris from each retrieved bag before drying at 55 C for a minimum of 5 days, and weighing.
