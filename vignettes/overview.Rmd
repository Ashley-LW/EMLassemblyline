## Basic use case

The basic use case, creating and maintaining EML for a dataset, consists of five steps:

1. [Organize data package](https://clnsmth.github.io/EMLassemblyline/articles/organize_data_package.html) contents into a simple directory structure that is readable by `EMLassemblyline` and accords with user preferences.
2. [Create metadata templates](https://clnsmth.github.io/EMLassemblyline/articles/create_metadata_templates.html) using functions that automatically extract information from data entities.
3. [Edit metadata templates](https://clnsmth.github.io/EMLassemblyline/articles/edit_metadata_templates.html) with simple text and spreadsheet editors to supply information that could not be automatically extracted.
4. [Make EML](https://clnsmth.github.io/EMLassemblyline/articles/create_eml.html) metadata from templates and value added content automatically created by the `make_eml()` function.
5. [Publish data package](https://clnsmth.github.io/EMLassemblyline/articles/publish_data_package.html) in a data repository accepting EML metadata.

EML revisions and updates are done by simply editing relevant portions of the templates and rerunning the `make_eml()` function.

## Advanced use cases

Advanced use cases include:

-  [Automate data publication](https://clnsmth.github.io/EMLassemblyline/articles/automate_data_publication.html) for ongoing time series or data products derived from ongoing time series.
-  [Use EMLassemblyline via exchange format](https://clnsmth.github.io/EMLassemblyline/articles/emlassemblyline_via_exchange_format.html) to create EML from any metadata storage/organization system.
