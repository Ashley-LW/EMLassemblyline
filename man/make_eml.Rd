\usage{
make_eml(path)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{A path to the dataset working directory containing the 
completed metadata templates, \emph{eml_configuration.R}, 
\emph{datasetname_datatablename_factors.txt} (if factors are present), 
and \emph{geographic_coverage.txt} (if reporting detailed geographic 
coverage).}
}
\value{
Validation results printed to the \emph{Console}.
    
    An EML metadata file in the dataset working directory titled 
    \emph{packageID.xml}.
}
\description{
Translate user supplied metadata into the EML 
    schema, validate the EML, and write to file.
}
\details{
If validation fails, open the EML document in a .xml editor to identify 
    the source of error. Often the error is small and quickly resolved with 
    the aid of an editors schema congruence checker.
