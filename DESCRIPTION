Version: 0.0.0.9000
Authors@R: person("Colin", "Smith", email = "colin.smith@wisc.edu", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: A set of functions facilitating a workflow to create metadata
    for a user supplied data entity. Templates are copied to the working
    directory and instructions prompt the user to provide requisite 
    information. The user selects from a collection of functions to extract
    information from the data entities, and finally executes a fancy wrapper
    function to build, validate, and write the EML metadata to file.
