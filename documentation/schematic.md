# Schematic of the assembly line process

Start creating EML once you have compiled the data for publication (Fig. 1). Next import templates and view instructions to build up the core metadata. If this core metadata doen't adequately describe your data, then call on additional functions to define and extract custom details to include in the final EML file. Once you have built all the metadata parts, assemble them into EML, run a validation check, and write the EML file. The EML and your data comprise a package that can be uploaded into a publicly accessible repository for reuse and citation.
